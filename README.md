# Howell High School Technology Student Assosiation Website Submission

High School Level, 2018-2019

Howell High School TSA believes in the utmost transparency in our work, therefore all our code is public for your viewing! If you can peice it together, it's all yours to use as you want, as long as it isn't on your TSA project. This years design prompt is to make a music website, so here we are! Enjoy.
